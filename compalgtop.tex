\title{Computational Algebraic Topology}

\begin{document}
    \maketitle

    These are notes I'm making on computational algebraic topology, largely based on the course taught at the University of Oxford in Hilary (January-March) 2022 by Vidit Nanda. The course's notes are very good and probably what a reader would be better off using as a primary reference, but I'm hoping to go into some more detail and fill in more details/preliminaries/exercises throughout, and it'll also serve as a personal record of what I think I've understood.
